# TIL AI Camp - Upskilling Content

## Description
This repository contains 3 folders that will be used during the upskilling workshop for TIL AI Camp 2019. 

Participants can refer to the folder`1-mnist` and `2-cifar10` to familiarise themselves with the basics of machine learning where we make use of convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify digits from the MNIST handwritten digits dataset as well as to perform object classification using the CIFAR10 dataset. In both notebooks, participants are expected to fill in the missing fields before running the cells.

The `solution` folder contains the solutions to both notebooks, with the missing fields populated.
